# Introduction
Hi! I'm Nurhakim, a student in the Software Maintenance
and Evolution course.
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance
practices and how to work with legacy systems.
- **Fun fact**: I love playing badminton whenever I have free time (and friends to play with).
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in
maintaining and evolving software.
